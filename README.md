# Code Solutions and Explanations for Problems Covered in Class.


# part 2: Mathematics
Here, you will find links to code implementations for the problems we discussed in class. These codes are designed to provide step-by-step solutions to the problems, and you are encouraged to run them to see the results in action.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate that mathematics can be effectively translated into code, and these problems serve as a practical showcase of that principle. Whether you're exploring mathematical concepts, learning to code, or seeking to bridge the gap between theory and implementation, this repository is a valuable resource for understanding how mathematics and programming intersect.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and use these examples to deepen your understanding!
